# Intuition
To solve the problem of counting consistent strings, the key insight is that a string is consistent if and only if every character in the string appears in the `allowed` string. By converting `allowed` into a `HashSet`, we can quickly check if each character in the strings from the `words` array is in the `allowed` set. This approach allows for efficient verification of each string's consistency.

# Approach
1. **Convert the `allowed` String to a `HashSet`:** This will allow for constant-time checks to see if a character is allowed.
2. **Iterate Through Each String in `words`:** For each string, check if all its characters are present in the `HashSet`.
3. **Count Consistent Strings:** Maintain a count of strings that are consistent (i.e., all characters are found in the `allowed` set).

Here's a brief pseudocode for the approach:
1. Create a `HashSet<char>` from the `allowed` string.
2. Initialize a counter for consistent strings.
3. For each string in the `words` array:
   - Check if every character is in the `HashSet`.
   - If true, increment the counter.
4. Return the final count of consistent strings.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(m \cdot n)$$
  - Where `m` is the number of words in the `words` array and `n` is the length of the longest word. Checking each character of each word against the `HashSet` is linear with respect to the number of characters.

- Space complexity: $$O(k)$$
  - Where `k` is the number of distinct characters in the `allowed` string. The space complexity is dominated by the `HashSet` storing these distinct characters.


# Code
```csharp []
public class Solution {
    public int CountConsistentStrings(string allowed, string[] words) {
         // Convert allowed string to a HashSet for quick lookup
        HashSet<char> allowedSet = new HashSet<char>(allowed);
        int consistentCount = 0;

        // Iterate through each word in the words array
        foreach (string word in words)
        {
            bool isConsistent = true;

            // Check if each character in the word is in the allowed set
            foreach (char c in word)
            {
                if (!allowedSet.Contains(c))
                {
                    isConsistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            // If the word is consistent, increment the count
            if (isConsistent)
            {
                consistentCount++;
            }
        }

        return consistentCount;
    }
}
```
