## Project Structure
The project is organized into several sections, each dedicated to different types of problems (e.g., arrays, dynamic programming, graphs). For each problem, we provide:

1. **Problem Description**: A clear and concise summary of the problem as presented on LeetCode, including input/output requirements and constraints.
2. **Intuition**: Initial thoughts and reasoning behind approaching the problem, highlighting key insights that guide the solution.
3. **Approach**: A step-by-step explanation of the solution strategy, covering different methodologies such as brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, or dynamic programming, depending on the problem.
4. **Complexity Analysis**: Detailed analysis of the time and space complexity of the provided solution, helping readers understand the efficiency and scalability of the approach.
5. **Code Implementation**: Clean, well-commented code in multiple programming languages (e.g., Python, C#, Java) that solves the problem as per the described approach.
6. **Test Cases**: Examples of input scenarios along with their expected outputs to validate the solution's correctness.

## How to Use This Repository
