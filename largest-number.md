# Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
The problem requires us to arrange a list of non-negative integers such that their concatenation forms the largest possible number. My first thought was that this could be done by sorting the numbers in a way that prioritizes the most significant digits. However, simply sorting based on the numbers themselves wouldnâ€™t work due to different digit lengths. The key insight is that for any two numbers `a` and `b`, we should compare the concatenated strings `a + b` and `b + a` and sort them accordingly.

# Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
1. Convert each integer in the list to a string so that we can concatenate them for comparison.
2. Sort the string list using a custom comparator that compares the concatenated results of two numbers. Specifically, for two strings `a` and `b`, compare `a + b` and `b + a`, and sort them in descending order based on which concatenation is larger.
3. After sorting, if the largest number is `0`, return "0" (to handle cases like `[0, 0]`).
4. Join the sorted strings into a single string and return the result.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
  Sorting the array of numbers takes $$O(n \log n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of elements in the list. The custom comparator involves string concatenation, which in the worst case takes $$O(k)$$ per comparison, where $$k$$ is the average number of digits of the numbers. Thus, the total time complexity is $$O(n \log n \cdot k)$$.

- Space complexity:
<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
  The space complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the number of integers in the list. We need additional space to store the string representations of the integers and the result.


# Code
```csharp []
public class Solution {
     public string LargestNumber(int[] nums) {
        // Convert each number to a string
        List<string> numStrings = new List<string>();
        foreach (var num in nums) {
            numStrings.Add(num.ToString());
        }
        
        // Sort the strings using a custom comparison rule
        numStrings.Sort((a, b) => string.Compare(b + a, a + b));

        // If the largest number is "0", the result should be "0" (to handle cases like [0, 0])
        if (numStrings[0] == "0") {
            return "0";
        }

        // Join the sorted strings into one large number
        return string.Join("", numStrings);
    }
}
```
